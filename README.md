In Cambodia, there are two main types of NGOs: International NGOs, which must sign an MOU with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and local NGOs. They can be categorized into groups such as democracy and human rights organizations, development organizations, support organizations, community-based organizations (CBOs), and those involved in research and advocacy. There's also a database maintained by the Cooperation Committee for Cambodia that stores information on NGO activities since 2004. Would you like more detailed information on a specific type of NGO or how they operate in Cambodia?

That's a fantastic idea! Teaching programming to low-tech and non-tech students can be incredibly rewarding and impactful. Here are some strategies and resources that might help you get started:

### Strategies for Teaching Programming to Low-Tech and Non-Tech Students

1. **Unplugged Activities**: Start with activities that don't require computers. For example, you can use paper and pen to teach basic concepts like algorithms and loops. Websites like [CS Unplugged](https://csunplugged.org/) offer a variety of activities that teach computing concepts through games and puzzles¹.

2. **Interactive Tools**: Use simple, interactive tools that are easy to learn and use. Tools like [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) are great for beginners and can be used to teach basic programming concepts without needing advanced hardware³.

3. **Project-Based Learning**: Encourage students to work on small projects. This could be something as simple as creating a personal webpage using HTML and CSS. Projects help students apply what they've learned and see tangible results.

4. **Pair Programming**: Pair students together to work on coding tasks. This not only helps them learn from each other but also builds collaboration skills.

5. **Use of Visual Aids**: Diagrams, flowcharts, and other visual aids can help explain complex concepts in a more understandable way.

6. **Community and Support**: Create a supportive learning environment where students feel comfortable asking questions and making mistakes. Online forums and local meetups can also provide additional support and resources.
